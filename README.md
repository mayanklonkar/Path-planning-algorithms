# Path-planning-algorithms

## Objective
Visualizations of the two most popular path planning algorithms, Dijkstra's and A*, are implemented in this repository using Pygame.

## Dijkstra
Dijkstra is used to find shortest path between nodes in graph.

## A*

A* is one of the most successful search algorithms to find the shortest path between nodes or graphs. It is an informed search algorithm that uses information about path cost and heuristics (cost to reach from current to target node) to find the solution.
