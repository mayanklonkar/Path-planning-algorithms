# Path-planning-algorithms

## Objective
Visualizations of the two most popular path planning algorithms, Dijkstra's and A*, are implemented in this repository using Pygame.

In this visualisation, the following colour represents
* Blue - Start box
* Yellow - Target box
* Navy blue - Final path
* Grey - Obstacles
* Green - Box visited
  

## Dijkstra
Dijkstra is used to find shortest path between nodes in a graph. It searches each and every node till it reaches target position.

## A*

A* is one of the most successful search algorithms to find the shortest path between nodes or graphs. It is an informed search algorithm that uses information about path cost and heuristics (distance from current  node to the target node) to find the solution.
